    """Runs the GnIES algorithm on the given data, producing an estimate
    of the I-equivalence class and the intervention targets.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list of numpy.ndarray
        A list with the samples from the different environments, where
        each sample is an array with columns corresponding to
        variables and rows to observations.
    lmbda : float, default=None
        The penalization parameter for the penalized-likelihood
        score. If `None`, the BIC penalization is chosen, that is,
        `0.5 * log(N)` where `N` is the total number of observations,
        pooled across environments.
    known_targets : set, default=set()
        The set of known intervention targets, which are always kept
        as part of the target estimate of the outer procedure.
    approach : {'greedy', 'rank'}, default='greedy'
        The approach used by the outer procedure of GnIES. 'greedy'
        means that intervention targets are greedily added/removed;
        'rank' means that an ordering is found by first fitting a
        model with `I={1,...,p}`, and targets are added/removed in
        this order.
    I0 : set, default=set()
        If the 'greedy' approach is selected, specifies the initial
        set of intervention targets, to which targets are
        added/removed.
    phases : [{'forward', 'backward'}*], default=['forward', 'backward']
        If the 'greedy' approach is selected, specifies which phases
        of the outer procedure are run.
    direction : {'forward', 'backward'}, default='forward'
        If the 'rank' approach is selected, specifies whether we add or
        remove variables: if 'forward', we start with an empty
        intervention set and add targets according to the found
        ordering; if 'backward', we start with the full set and remove
        targets instead.
    ges_iterate : bool, default=False
        Indicates whether the phases of the inner procedure (modified
        GES) should be iterated more than once.
    ges_phases : [{'forward', 'backward', 'turning'}*], optional
        Which phases of the inner procedure (modified GES) are run,
        and in which order. Defaults to `['forward', 'backward',
        'turning']`.
    debug : int, default=0
        If larger than 0, debug are traces printed. Higher values
        correspond to increased verbosity.

    Returns
    -------
    score : float
        The penalized likelihood score of the GnIES estimate.
    icpdag : numpy.ndarray
        The I-CPDAG representing the estimated I-equivalence class,
        where `icpdag[i,j] != 0` implies the edge `i -> j` and
        `icpdag[i,j] != 0 & icpdag[j,i] != 0` implies the edge `i -
        j`.
    I : set of ints
        The estimate of the intervention targets.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError:
        If an invalid value is selected for the `approach` parameter.
